Cost-sensitive multiclass classification with Adaptive Regularization of Weights

This is a simple and efficient implementation of the Adaptive Regularization of Weights (AROW) algorithm for classification (http://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips22/NIPS2009_0611.pdf). It is in python and it relies on the very efficient sparse vector implementation by Liang Huang (http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~huanlian/software/hvector-1.0.tar.bz) which must be downloaded separately. While it is not as efficient as other implementations in C++ such as arowpp (http://code.google.com/p/arowpp/), it offers the following:

    multiclass classification
    cost-sensitive classification
    probability estimates

In order to run it and see how the API is used, please download a version of the 20 newsgroups dataset available here: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html#news20.binary.

This looks like:

`-1 1:0.016563 2:0.016563 3:0.016563 4:0.016563 5:0.016563 6:0.016563 7:0.016563 8:0.016563 ...` with 1328800 examples, with the second argument for each example being the label of which of the 20 newsgroups it belongs to.

Then run (remember to install Liang Huang's sparse vector package first to install the necessary modules e.g. `_mycollections`):

`python arow.py news20.binary`

You should see the following:

```
Reading the data
training data: 14997 instances
Training with 14997 instances
Training with param=0.01 on 13497 instances
Training error rate in round 0 : 0.110246721494
...
Training error rate in round 9 : 0.00296362154553
Final training error rate=0.00133362969549
Final training cost=18
testing on 1499 instances
Dev cost:68 avg cost per instance 0.0453635757171
...
```

In terms of the input data format, your data should look like: 

```
[   "-1 1:0.1 2:0.5 9:0.1",
    "+1 1:0.6 2:0.2 8:0.2",
    "-1 1:0.1 2:0.6 8:0.3",
    "+1 1:0.4 2:0.7 9:0.4",
]
```

Where the first argument is whether the instance is positive or negative, and the other part of the instance specifies what the costs of each label for that instance is.
